# SandalStrap

SandalStrap, also known as Sandal is a Sass bootstrap entirely based on mixins. There are no classes in Sandal, rather you use mixins to change your code. There is no need to update your html when you need to change a style, rather, simply go to your sass and make the edits. This is aimed to make coding CSS more bearable. We have made the complex mixins for you to use such that you never need to look at them again!
